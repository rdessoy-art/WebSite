            <h2>Early Morning: The Day Begins</h2>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>6:00 AM - Wake Up and Nutrition</h3>
                <p>Harrison's day starts early. A proper breakfast is crucial to fuel the intensive training ahead. Today's menu includes porridge with berries, eggs, and a protein shake - carefully planned to provide sustained energy throughout the morning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>7:00 AM - Morning Cardio</h3>
                <p>Before most people have started their commute, Harrison is already an hour into his day with a 45-minute cycling session. Cardiovascular fitness is essential for maintaining focus and physical performance during long races.</p>
                <p>The morning cardio session helps build the endurance needed to compete at peak levels throughout entire race weekends.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Mid-Morning: Strength and Conditioning</h2>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>9:00 AM - Gym Session with Mark Walker</h3>
                <p>After a quick recovery period, Harrison heads to the gym for targeted strength training with his fitness coach, Mark Walker. Mark trains international athletes and brings world-class expertise to Harrison's conditioning programme. Today's focus is on core stability and neck strengthening - both critical for handling the extreme forces experienced on a Superbike.</p>
                <p>Under Mark's guidance, the session includes exercises specifically designed for motorcycle racing: weighted neck exercises, core stability work on balance boards, and explosive power training. Mark's experience with elite athletes ensures every exercise is purposeful and effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>11:00 AM - Recovery and Nutrition</h3>
                <p>Recovery is just as important as training. Harrison takes time for stretching, physiotherapy, and a carefully planned lunch designed to aid muscle recovery and prepare for the afternoon's track session.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Afternoon: Track Time</h2>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>1:00 PM - Track Preparation</h3>
                <p>Arriving at the circuit, Harrison meets with his technical team to review data from previous sessions and discuss the afternoon's objectives. They analyze telemetry, discuss setup changes, and plan specific aspects to work on during today's track time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>2:00 PM - On-Track Session</h3>
                <p>This is what it's all about. Harrison spends two hours on the bike, working through various drills and exercises designed to refine his technique. Today's focus includes corner entry speeds, trail braking techniques, and race simulations.</p>
                <p>Between sessions, the team reviews real-time data, makes adjustments to the bike's setup, and provides feedback to help Harrison extract every tenth of a second from each lap.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Inside the Track Session</h3>
                <p>A typical track session isn't just about lapping as fast as possible. Harrison and his team methodically work through specific objectives:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                    <li>Warm-up laps to build tire temperature and confidence</li>
                    <li>Focused work on individual corners and sections</li>
                    <li>Race simulation laps to practice consistency</li>
                    <li>Practice starts and first-lap scenarios</li>
                    <li>Cool-down laps and immediate debrief</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Evening: Analysis and Recovery</h2>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>5:00 PM - Video and Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>Back in the team's office, Harrison spends time reviewing onboard footage and telemetry data from the afternoon's session. This analysis helps identify areas for improvement and validates what worked well.</p>
                <p>Comparing data traces from different laps reveals where time can be gained and where Harrison is already at the limit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>6:30 PM - Recovery Protocol</h3>
                <p>Physical recovery is critical. Harrison's evening routine includes massage therapy, stretching, and sometimes ice baths to reduce inflammation and prepare the body for tomorrow's training.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>7:30 PM - Dinner and Mental Prep</h3>
                <p>A nutritious dinner rich in protein and vegetables helps with overnight recovery. Harrison also spends time on mental preparation, using visualization techniques to mentally rehearse race scenarios and build confidence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="time-block">
                <h3>9:00 PM - Wind Down</h3>
                <p>Before bed, Harrison reviews the next day's schedule, responds to messages, and perhaps checks in with fans on social media. Quality sleep is crucial for performance, so bedtime is consistent and protected.</p>
